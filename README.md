# To-Do-List-Web-Application
Welcome to the To-Do List Web Application, a simple yet powerful tool built with Python Flask! This application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently, ensuring that nothing slips through the cracks.
Features

    User Registration & Login: New users can easily sign up and create an account. Existing users can log in using their credentials.
    Personalized To-Do Lists: Each user has a unique to-do list saved in a private file, ensuring that your tasks remain confidential.
    Task Management: Users can add tasks with deadlines, edit, and delete them as needed, making it easy to stay organized.
    Admin Controls: An admin account is automatically created (Username: admin, Password: adminpassword) to manage user accounts, including the ability to delete users.

How It Works

    Sign Up or Log In: Start by signing up to create your account or log in if you already have one.
    Manage Your Tasks: After logging in, you’ll access your personal to-do list. Add tasks with due dates, and keep your life organized!
    Privacy: Each user’s to-do list is saved in a file named username+to_do.txt, ensuring no one can access others' lists.
    Admin Features: The admin account can oversee user accounts, providing an extra layer of management.
